This is most likely happening due to a hidden power option called System unattended sleep timeout. On my machine it was set to 2 minutes, which was mighty annoying, as it would cause behavior described by OP (sleep, wake-up, login screen, Event Viewer saying: "The system is entering sleep; Sleep Reason: System Idle"). You have to enable this option in registry before being able to change it.
